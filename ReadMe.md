**Localizations for FieldWorks**

The authoritative list of supported languages is maintained at https://crowdin.com/project/fieldworks/settings#translations. To add a new language, you will also need to update the following locations in the FieldWorks repository (https://github.com/sillsdev/fieldworks):
- Build/Installer.targets (CopyFilesToInstall, HarvestAllL10ns)
- FLExInstaller/CustomComponents.wxi (multiple places)
- FLExInstaller/CustomFeatures.wxi
- Â¿Others?
- Linux localization package specifications need regenerated for new localizations to be shipped:

  1. Checkout the latest localization files.

          cd ~/fwrepo/fw/Localizations
          git fetch
          git checkout origin/develop

  2. Generate l10n package specifications.

          cd ~/fwrepo/debian
          git fetch
          git checkout origin/release/9.0 # Or similar release branch.
          ./generate-l10n-control-entries ../fw

  3. Merge in changes, and push the result.

          meld control-l10n control

**Removing or adding strings**

If you remove strings from FieldWorks you will need to get your system ready to run the `uploadUpdatesForTranslation` build target.

1. Make sure that you have liblcm cloned locally, checked out to the right branch, and specified in your `LibraryDevelopment.properties` file.
2. Set the `CROWDIN_API_KEY` to the version 1 Api key for the FieldWorks crowdin project.
3. `build /t:uploadUpdatesForTranslation`
